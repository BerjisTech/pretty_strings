# Pretty Strings

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/pretty_strings.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/pretty_strings) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/diasks2/pretty_strings.png)](https://travis-ci.org/diasks2/pretty_strings) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/diasks2/pretty_strings/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

Some strings have been abused by being run through many a CAT tool (one too many times). When you only want text and you don't want any inline tags, triple-escaped HTML entities or the like then this gem is for you.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

**Ruby**  
```
gem install pretty_strings
```

**Ruby on Rails**  
Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:  
```ruby 
gem 'pretty_strings'
```

## Usage

```ruby
text = "&amp;lt;CharStyle:body copy&amp;gt;The Supe&amp;lt;cTracking:-75&amp;gt;r&amp;lt;cTracking:&amp;gt;Track system is easy to set up and use, providing real-time &amp;lt;SoftReturn&amp;gt;insight and stats."
PrettyStrings::Cleaner.new(text).pretty

# => "The SuperTrack system is easy to set up and use, providing real-time insight and stats."
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
